# Read bytes from AnyBitmap
Users have the option of manipulating AnyBitmap file in terms of bytes. IronDrawing have methods to **Get**, **Export**, and **Read** bytes of AnyBitmap file. 

The image file to be read can be loaded using file path <code>AnyBitmap.FromFile(@"FILE_PATH")</code> and stored in an AnyBitmap variable. The variable can then be manipulated to get bytes using <code>.GetBytes()</code> method, export bytes with option to change the image format and degree of image loss using <code>.ExportBytes(AnyBitmap.ImageFormat.Format, 10)</code> method and read all bytes of the file using <code>File.ReadAllBytes(@"FILE_PATH")</code> method.

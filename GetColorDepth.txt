# Get Color Depth
Color depth is measured in bits per pixel or bpp, used to give information on the color components, in terms of either bits used to indicate the color of a single pixel or number of bits used for each color component of a single pixel. It can also used to determine the quality of an image at some point as different image bpp results in different outcome quality of image (higher bpp, more image definition).

An image file to be read can be loaded from a file path <code>AnyBitmap.FromFile(@"FILE_PATH")</code>. <code>.BitsPerPixel</code> can then be used on the generated AnyBitmap to get the color depth.

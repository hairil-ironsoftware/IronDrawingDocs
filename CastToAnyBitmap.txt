# Cast to AnyBitmap
In order to use and manipulate any image file in IronDrawing, all files must be converted to AnyBitmap file, and for files from other platforms, IronDrawing are able to cast the files to AnyBitmap files. Following are examples of image files from other platforms that can be cast to AnyBitmap file

## System.Drawing.Bitmap
Bitmap from System Drawing can be casted to AnyBitmap files  by loading a System Drawing file from file path using <code>System.Drawing.Bitmap(@"FILE_PATH")</code> then cast the file by assigning it to a variable initialized with AnyBitmap type.

## System.Drawing.Image
Casting images from System Image can be done by loading the file from a file path using <code>System.Drawing.Image.FromFile(@"FILE_PATH")</code> and store it in a variable with AnyBitmap type.

## SkiaSharp.SKBitmap
Casting bitmap from SkiaSharp can be done by initializing a <code>SkiaSharp.SKBitmap</code> variable and store the file loaded from a file path using <code>SkiaSharp.SKBitmap.Decode(@"FILE_PATH")</code>. The file can then be cast to AnyBitmap type by storing it in a variable with AnyBitmap type.

## SkiaSharp.SKImage
To load SkiaSharp image load the file using <code>SkiaSharp.SKImage.FromBitmap(SkiaSharp.SKBitmap.Decode(@"FILE_PATH")</code> and store inside a SkiaSharp.SKImage variable. It can then be cast to AnyBitmap file by assigning it to a variable of AnyBitmap type.

## SixLabors
Images from SixLabors can be loaded from file path using the code <code>SixLabors.ImageSharp.Image.Load<SixLabors.ImageSharp.PixelFormats.Rgba32>(@"FILE_PATH")</code> and store it in <code>SixLabors.ImageSharp.Image<SixLabors.ImageSharp.PixelFormats.Rgba32></code> variable. It can then be casted into AnyBitmap file by assigning it to an AnyBitmap variable.

## Maui Image
Casting of Maui image to AnyBitmap file can only be done in **environments other than NET4.7.2**. Maui image file can be loaded by read the bytes of the image obtained from a file path using <code>File.ReadAllBytes(@"FILE_PATH")</code> and store the bytes in an array <code>byte[]</code>. The bytes must be translated into image by using <code>Microsoft.Maui.Graphics.Platform.PlatformImage.FromStream(new MemoryStream(byte[]))</code> and can then be casted to AnyBitmap file by assigning it to a variable of AnyBitmap type.
